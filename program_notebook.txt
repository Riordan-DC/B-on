Hidden from me when I lack discipline:
I saw the cover a book today, it was called "Statutory Interpretation".
The cover of the book broke up the words into four letter words so I had
to put these together in my head to find the right words. But this was not
so easy because the four letter segments were obfuscated with cloud. So
my brain had to interpret the four letter segments and piece them together
correctly. This was a chicken or egg problem. I need to interpret the segments
but they are blocked by cloud. Maybe the word wont make sense if I dont do this.
Or perhaps if I know the word I can estimate the word and therefore, its segments, 
better. I really liked this process and after reading just the title of a book, 
I came away like I had discovered something hidden at a cursory glance. 

Limits
Any sort of first game I produce will be very simple. Limited to a single scene most
likely. I was thinking about a game wherein you sit at a typewriter. You could solve 
crimes at this desk and like vim you use keys to move between states like clicking
keys and picking letters to read.
