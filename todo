When you press space I want to toggle the control of the mouse, 
between tracking the view of the camera and free pointing to the GUI. It will
need to talk to the window system also which will enable and disable visability of the
pointer and allow  for infinite movement.

Build logging system. Add more logging states.

define some strong assertions to prevent mistakes early on.

Better shader class. With better logging.

Better garbage collection and control.

Do deferred rendering

ECS (Entity component system) Give each entity an index that is mapped to a pointer of the entity.

Right now we have alot of cache misses when looking for objects in the game world. 
because OOP scatters "encapsulated" data across the heap. So we miss the cache a lot looking
for data in the heap. This is why we need to focus on Data-Oriented design. You can still use C++
but remember to focus and rewrite with DO design. 

STICK TO A CODING STYLE SHEET OMG. MAKE IT RIGHT AWAY.
